## Hello!
Iâ€™m currently learning web design, (using html, css and some others) and graphic design, so I hope that this repo will be helpful along my journey.
Previouslly, I have worked in Blender, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and Krita, primarily for some cobination of school, recreation, or in colaboration with some of my friends.
I wish to make many things in the future, and I am quite excited.
